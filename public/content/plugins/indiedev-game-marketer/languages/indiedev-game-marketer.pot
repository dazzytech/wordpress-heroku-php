"Creating a good game is hard, but that's only half the battle.  If you don't "
"market your game, chances are fewer people will end up playing it!  Indiedev "
"Game Marketer is an open source Wordpress plugin, forever free and forever "
"without a premium version to buy. Why? Because making a good game is hard, "
"but making a good marketing campaign is usually just as hard, if not even "
"more difficult, especially if you don't come from a marketing background.  "
"Time is money, and it is my hope that this plugin will help indies more "
"affectively market their games, without increasing the cost of marketing.  "
"However, this plugin is just a tool that covers the bare minimums, and while "
"it hopefully makes your life easier, the hard work of marketing is still up "
"to you to complete.  Good luck!"
